# Introduction to Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are fundamental to computer science and are used to arrange data in a specific order. This document covers several key sorting algorithms.

## Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Time Complexity:
- Best Case: O(n)
- Average Case: O(n²)
- Worst Case: O(n²)

Space Complexity: O(1)

## Merge Sort

Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.

Time Complexity:
- Best Case: O(n log n)
- Average Case: O(n log n)
- Worst Case: O(n log n)

Space Complexity: O(n)

## Quick Sort

Quick Sort is another divide-and-conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot.

Time Complexity:
- Best Case: O(n log n)
- Average Case: O(n log n)
- Worst Case: O(n²)

Space Complexity: O(log n)

## Binary Search

Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding an element in a sorted array. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)

## Conclusion

Choosing the right sorting algorithm depends on the specific requirements of your application, including the size of the data, memory constraints, and whether the data is partially sorted.
